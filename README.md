Lab 1.1 â€” Another 'Hello world' program (14 lines)
Write a C++ program to print the following console output:

+----------------------+

| Hello from CISC 3142 |

+----------------------+

Lab 1.2

Write a C++ program with the following 3 methods:

1. method that accepts 3 parameters as reference variables, and reads in 3 variables of type double 
2. method that accepts 3 double parameters, and calculates some non-trivial mathematical function (for ex: triangle's area based on sides)
3. main that declares the variables, calls the methods, and prints all results.

   NOTE: you do not need to pass cin to the read method

   Remember to declare the function on top if you write main first.
